    <p>
       Flow Consulting Group Inc. provides hands-on consulting services for new

       Most of my time was spent dawing both mechanical and electrical plans for
       sites all over the lower mainland of BC, analyzing drawings in pursuit of
        performing airflow calculations with HAP Software, and calculating
        specifications for water supply and drainage based on building drawings
        from clients</p>
